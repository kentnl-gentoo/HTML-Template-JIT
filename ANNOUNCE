DESCRIPTION

This module provides a just-in-time compiler for HTML::Template.
Templates are compiled into native machine code using Inline::C.  The
compiled code is then stored to disk and reused on subsequent calls.

HTML::Template::JIT is up to 8 times as fast as HTML::Template using
caching.


NOTE

This module is not feature-complete.  Be sure to read the CAVEATS
section in the documentation before using!
