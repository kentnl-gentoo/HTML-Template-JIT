ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template::JIT 0.03

HTML::Template::JIT - a just-in-time compiler for HTML::Template

CHANGES

- Added support for case_sensitive option to new().

- Added new print_to_stdout option to new() to have output
  printed to STDOUT as it is generated.
 
- Added support for ESCAPE.  Template syntax support is now
  complete

- Improved the quality of generated code - variables are now
  looked-up once and stored in lexical variables.  This has
  improved performance a small amount.

- Fixed bug in escaping of template text.  This caused templates
  containing the characters any of ($, @, %, \) to be rendered
  incorrectly.  Thanks to Smejkal Petr for the report.

- Fixed bug where parameters from previous runs were persisting
  across calls to new().  Thanks to Tugrul Galatali for the spot.

- Arguments to new() that modify the compiled object are now
  included in hashing to create package names.  This means that
  a single template can be used with different options and
  different compiled objects will be generated.  Thanks to
  Tugrul Galatali for the spot.


DESCRIPTION

This module provides a just-in-time compiler for HTML::Template.
Templates are compiled into native machine code using Inline::C.  The
compiled code is then stored to disk and reused on subsequent calls.

HTML::Template::JIT is up to 8 times as fast as HTML::Template using
caching.


NOTE

This module is not feature-complete.  Be sure to read the CAVEATS
section in the documentation before using!
