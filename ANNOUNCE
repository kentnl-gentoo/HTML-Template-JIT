ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template::JIT 0.02

HTML::Template::JIT - a just-in-time compiler for HTML::Template

CHANGES

- Added support for loop_context_vars.

- Added support for global_vars.

- Fixed bug in loop param handling that made loop variables
  case-sensitive.


DESCRIPTION

This module provides a just-in-time compiler for HTML::Template.
Templates are compiled into native machine code using Inline::C.  The
compiled code is then stored to disk and reused on subsequent calls.

HTML::Template::JIT is up to 4 times as fast as HTML::Template using
caching.


NOTE

This module is not feature-complete.  Be sure to read the CAVEATS
section in the documentation before using!
