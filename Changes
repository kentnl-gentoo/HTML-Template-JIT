      - Fixed bug in escaping of template text.  This caused templates
        containing the characters any of ($, @, %, \) to be rendered
        incorrectly.  Thanks to Smejkal Petr for the report.

      - Improved the quality of generated code - variables are now
        looked-up once and stored in lexical variables.  This has
        improved performance a small amount.

      - Fixed bug where parameters from previous runs were persisting
        across calls to new().  Thanks to Tugrul Galatali for the spot.

      - Arguments to new() that modify the compiled object are now
        included in hashing to create package names.  This means that
        a single template can be used with different options and
        different compiled objects will be generated.  Thanks to
        Tugrul Galatali for the spot.

      - Added support for case_sensitive option to new().
      
      - Added new print_to_stdout option to new() to have output
        printed to STDOUT as it is generated.

      - Added support for ESCAPE.  Template syntax support is now
        complete.
